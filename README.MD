# 🛰️ WhereCode: The Intertemporal AI Orchestrator

> **⚡ Fuel the Machine**: This project is 100% AI-authored. To help us maintain high-quality model outputs and explore the boundaries of MCP, consider sponsoring **Tokens** or **API Credits**.

**WhereCode** is a pioneering cross-device development framework. It liberates developers from their desks, using mobile devices as intent terminals, PC as the execution engine, and collaborating with a diverse team of AI partners.

## 🤖 AI Declaration

**Every line of code in this repository is authored by AI, including but not limited to: Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI), GLM (Zhipu), DeepSeek, and MiniMax.**

AI's roles in this project include:
- **Architecture Design**: Deconstructing and designing multi-layer logic based on human intent.
- **Implementation**: Generating full backend logic, protocol encapsulation, and functional modules.
- **QA & Debugging**: Writing automated test scripts and self-healing based on error logs.
- **Documentation**: Authoring this README, PLAN.md, and technical specifications.
- **Compliance Guidance**: Selecting open-source licenses (AGPL-3.0) and organizing declarations.

> **Note**: The human developer acts as the **"Architect" and "Decision Maker"**, defining the vision, auditing logic nodes, and authorizing key execution steps via mobile.

## 🏗️ The Trinity Architecture

1. **Command Center (Mobile)**
   - **Role**: CEO.
   - **Function**: Strategic instructions, task approval, and resource allocation via a minimalist dialogue UI.
2. **Control Center (Local PC)**
   - **Role**: COO / Orchestrator.
   - **Function**: Intent alignment (Task Manifesto), MCP-based tool routing, and automated Gatekeeper (testing).
3. **Action Layer (AI Agents)**
   - **Role**: Senior Engineers.
   - **Function**: Executing file operations, refactoring, and providing technical feedback via MCP Skills.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Intent**: User sends a command via mobile (e.g., "Refactor login module").
2. **Consensus**: PC returns a "Task Manifesto"; user approves.
3. **Autonomy**: Orchestrator assigns tasks to specific Agents (e.g., Claude-3.5).
4. **QA**: PC runs `pytest` automatically; AI fixes issues autonomously if tests fail.
5. **Briefing**: User receives a push notification with a summary of changes.
6. **Final Review**: User performs a physical merge review at the PC.

## 🧩 Protocols & Skills

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: The core protocol for standardized tool access.
- **Communication Tunnel**: Pluggable support for secure remote access (CF Tunnel, frp, Direct IP).

## 📦 Monorepo Dependency Policy

This repository contains three subprojects with different stacks and dependency sets.

- `command_center/`: Next.js + Tailwind (Node.js ecosystem)
- `control_center/`: FastAPI + Pydantic (Python ecosystem)
- `action_layer/`: Agent runtime and integrations (can vary by provider/runtime)

To avoid cross-stack coupling, dependency and environment files must stay inside each subproject.
Root-level dependency files (such as `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `run.sh`) are intentionally not used.

Unified subproject command entry:

```bash
bash scripts/stationctl.sh install all
bash scripts/stationctl.sh dev all
bash scripts/stationctl.sh start all
bash scripts/stationctl.sh status all
bash scripts/stationctl.sh stop all
bash scripts/stationctl.sh check
```

## 📅 Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1**: Establish secure communication via pluggable tunnels.
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Implement MCP-based Agent management system.
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Develop mobile UI and MiniMax-powered ASR module.
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Build AI-driven async notification engine.
