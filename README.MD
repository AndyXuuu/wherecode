# 🛰️ WhereCode: The Intertemporal AI Orchestrator

**WhereCode** is a pioneering cross-device development framework. It liberates developers from their desks, using mobile devices as intent terminals, PC as the execution engine, and collaborating with a diverse team of AI partners.

### 🤖 AI Declaration

**Every line of code in this repository is authored by AI, including but not limited to: Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI), GLM (Zhipu), DeepSeek, and MiniMax.**

AI's roles in this project include:
* **Architecture Design**: Deconstructing and designing multi-layer logic based on human intent.
* **Implementation**: Generating full backend logic, protocol encapsulation, and functional modules.
* **QA & Debugging**: Writing automated test scripts and self-healing based on error logs.
* **Documentation**: Authoring this README, PLAN.md, and technical specifications.
* **Compliance Guidance**: Selecting open-source licenses (AGPL-3.0) and organizing declarations.

> **Note**: The human developer acts as the **"Architect" and "Decision Maker"**, defining the vision, auditing logic nodes, and authorizing key execution steps via mobile.

## 🏗️ The Trinity Architecture



1.  **Command Center (Mobile)**
    * **Role**: CEO. 
    * **Function**: Strategic instructions, task approval, and resource allocation via a minimalist dialogue UI.
2.  **Control Center (Local PC)**
    * **Role**: COO / Orchestrator.
    * **Function**: Intent alignment (Task Manifesto), MCP-based tool routing, and automated Gatekeeper (testing).
3.  **Action Layer (AI Agents)**
    * **Role**: Senior Engineers.
    * **Function**: Executing file operations, refactoring, and providing technical feedback via MCP Skills.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1.  **Intent**: User sends a command via mobile (e.g., "Refactor login module").
2.  **Consensus**: PC returns a "Task Manifesto"; user approves.
3.  **Autonomy**: Orchestrator assigns tasks to specific Agents (e.g., Claude-3.5).
4.  **QA**: PC runs `pytest` automatically; AI fixes issues autonomously if tests fail.
5.  **Briefing**: User receives a push notification with a summary of changes.
6.  **Final Review**: User performs a physical merge review at the PC.

## 🧩 Protocols & Skills
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: The core protocol for standardized tool access.
- **Communication Tunnel**: Pluggable support for secure remote access (CF Tunnel, frp, Direct IP).

## 📅 Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Establish secure communication via pluggable tunnels.
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Implement MCP-based Agent management system.
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Develop mobile UI and MiniMax-powered ASR module.
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Build AI-driven async notification engine.
